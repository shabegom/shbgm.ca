This is my personal website/resume project. I wanted to tackle building my own SSR React App using Next.js. I also wanted to try out GraphQL, so I converted the contentful JS library into a GraphQL server. Everything is hosted on Netlify which deploys whenever I merge into master. Overall I'm very happy with this setup. All the content is written and version controlled in Contentful and Netlify handled the build and deploy pipeline with very little configuration.
